# DSA Practicals

### Practical No. 01  
Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using hashing and handle collisions using chaining with / without replacement. Data: Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to value, Keys must be comparable, Keys must be unique. Standard Operations : Insert(key, value), Find(key), Delete(key).

### Practical No. 02   
To create ADT that implement the "set" concept.   
a. Add (new Element) - Place a value into the set ,    
b. Remove (element) Remove the value,    
c. Contains (element) Return true if element is in collection,    
d. Size () Return number of values in collection Iterator () Return an iterator used to loop over collection,   
e. Intersection of two sets ,   
f. Union of two sets, 
g. Difference between two sets, 
h. Subset.

### Practical No. 03
Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree -   
i. Insert new node,    
ii. Find number of nodes in longest path from root,    
iii. Minimum data value found in the tree,   
iv. Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every node,   
v. Search a value.  

### Practical No. 04  
A book consists of chapters, chapters consist of sections and sections consist of subsections. Construct a tree and print the nodes. Find the time and space requirements of your method.

### Practical No. 05
There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B then there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight take to reach city B from A, or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a graph. The node can be represented by airport name or name of the city. Use adjacency list representation of the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the graph. Check whether the graph is connected or not. Justify the storage representation used.  

### Practical No. 06   
Represent a given graph using adjacency matrix/list to perform DFS and using adjacency list to perform BFS. Use the map of the area around the college as the graph. Identify the prominent land marks as nodes and perform DFS and BFS on that.   

### Practical No. 07   
Construct an expression tree from the given prefix expression eg. +--a*bc/def and traverse it using post order traversal (non recursive) and then delete the entire tree.   

### Practical No. 08   
Given sequence k = k1 <k2 < â€¦ <kn of n sorted keys, with a search probability pi for each key ki . Build the Binary search tree that has the least search cost given the access probability for each key?

### Practical No. 09
A Dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Binary Search Tree for implementation.

### Practical No. 10
Consider a scenario for Hospital to cater services to different kinds of patients as Serious (top priority), b) non-serious (medium priority), c) General Checkup (Least priority). Implement the priority queue to cater services to the patients.  

### Practical No. 11
Department maintains a student information. The file contains roll number, name, division and address. Allow user to add, delete information of student. Display information of particular employee. If record of student does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the student details. Use sequential file to main the data.

### Practical No. 12
Department maintains a student information. The file contains roll number, name, division and address. Allow user to add, delete information of student. Display information of particular employee. If record of student does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the student details. Use sequential file to main the data.
